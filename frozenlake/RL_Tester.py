    '''
    We have learned quite a bit about the q-learning agent from this excercise. I enumerate through these points below.
    1. Based on the reward system, the Agent will maximize its long term rewards such that
     if it is more rewarding not to win, it will not. I found that when I gave the agent
     a 0.5 reward for staying alive (I thought this would cause it to do a better job at avoiding holes),
     I instead found that the agent learned instead to never reach the goal position, as by staying alive for
     the entire duration of the episode, it could maximize its reward versus getting one slightly larger reward of 1 once.
    2. The exploration rate must be such that it does not spend too much time exploring,
     while also not spending too little time either. Over-exploring results in aggregately random results across episodes.
     Under-exploring leads to the agent being unable to gain any new knowledge about its environment.
    3.
